    "<p>In the example above, LRP rules could be easily expressed in terms of matrix-vector operations. In practice, state-of-the-art neural networks such as VGG-16 make use of more complex layers such as convolutions and pooling. In this case, LRP rules are more conveniently implemented by casting the operations of the four-step procedure above as <em>forward</em> and <em>gradient</em> evaluations on these layers. These operations are readily available in neural network frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow, and can therefore be reused for the purpose of implementing LRP. Here, we take the VGG-16 pretrained network for image classification. For this network, we consider the task of explaining the evidence for the class \"castle\" it has found in the following image:</p>\n",
